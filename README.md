# ML at Brno

This repository, is for my Machine Learning Projects during my 3 months exchange program at Brno University of Technology (BUT), Czech Republic.
You can find here my exercises, and **Labs** assigned during the machine learning course and my **final_project**.

## Final Project
The `final_project/` is a group project I worked on with my friend and colleague Clark ALOPH. Our project aimed to classify the number of persons in a room using 60 GHz signal transmission, applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to interpret signal snapshots within the delay-Doppler domain.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my gratitude to the faculty BUT for their support and collaboration. A special thanks to ISEP for providing the opportunity for this international exchange program.
